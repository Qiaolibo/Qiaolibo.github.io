To discover more possibilities in interaction design field, we try to combine different advanced device as mush as we can, to create a realistic experience, even beyond reality, and make the interaction process smoothly.

# An idea hexagon - Solution-driven approach
### Finding the neXt
The hexagon provide a systematic way to generate many unique solutions

#### Three principles
- Start with something new, interesting, never seen before.
- Iterate quick. by looking for variations of solutions and problems.
- Give up soutions quick.

#### Calibration
This transformation is called an extrinsic matrix(外部矩阵) of a camera. This operation is also called homographic transformation(单应变换).
